3. Save this number (e.g., `123456789`)

### 3. Group Chat IDs
For each group you want to manage:
1. Add your bot to the private group
2. Make the bot an **administrator** with **"Invite Users"** permission
3. Forward any message from the group to `@userinfobot`

## Installation & Deployment on Render

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. **Clone or create the project:**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd gateway
```

2. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done):
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Multi-Group Portal Bot"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-portal-bot.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Render

1. **Sign up/Login** to [Render](https://render.com/)

2. **Create New Service:**
   - Click **"New +"** ‚Üí **"Background Worker"**
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select the `gateway` repository

3. **Configure Service:**
   - **Name**: `telegram-portal-bot` (or your choice)
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python bot.py`

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
   Click **"Advanced"** ‚Üí **"Add Environment Variable"**
   
   - **BOT_TOKEN**
     - Value: Your bot token from BotFather
     - Example: `1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`
   
   - **ADMIN_IDS**
     - Value: Comma-separated list of admin user IDs
     - Example: `123456789,987654321`
     - For single admin: `123456789`

5. **Add Persistent Disk (IMPORTANT):**
   Scroll down to **"Disk"** section and click **"Add Disk"**
   
   - **Mount Path**: `/var/data`
   - This ensures your groups and settings persist across restarts
   - Without this, all data will be lost when the service restarts!

6. **Deploy:**
   - Click **"Create Background Worker"**
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Check logs to verify bot is running

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

Look for these messages in Render logs:
```

### For Users

1. **Start the bot:**
```
/start
```

2. **Choose what you want to do:**
   - Click a group button to join that group (invite opens directly!)
   - Click **"üîó Get My Referral Link"** to see your referral link and stats

3. **Join a group:**
   - Accept the invite and you're in!
   - The link works only once for security

4. **Share your referral link:**
   - Get it from the main menu button or by sending `/referral`
   - Share your unique link with others
   - Track how many people join through your link
   - Check your referral statistics anytime

## Referral System

### How It Works

The bot includes a built-in referral tracking system using Telegram's deep linking feature. Every user automatically gets a unique referral link they can share with others.

### For Community Members

**Get Your Referral Link (Two Ways):**

**Option 1 - Main Menu Button (Easiest):**
1. Send `/start` to the bot
2. Click the **"üîó Get My Referral Link"** button at the bottom

**Option 2 - Command:**
```
/referral
```

Both will display:
- Your unique referral link (e.g., `https://t.me/YourBot?start=ref_123456789`)
- Number of people you've referred
- Simple statistics about your referrals

**Share Your Link:**
- Send your referral link to friends, post it on social media, or share it in communities
- When someone clicks your link, starts the bot, **and joins a group**, they count as your referral
- Each person only counts once (when they join their first group)
- You can check your stats anytime with `/referral`

### For Admins

**View Referral Statistics:**
1. Open admin panel: `/admin`
2. Click "üìä Referral Statistics"

This shows:
- Total registered users (all who started the bot)
- Users who joined groups (actually engaged)
- Total number of referrals (only counts users who joined groups)
- Conversion rate (percentage of users who joined groups)
- Referral rate (percentage of joined users who were referred)
- Top 10 referrers with their user IDs and referral counts
- Medal emojis (ü•áü•àü•â) for the top 3 referrers

### Technical Details

- Uses Telegram deep linking with format: `https://t.me/BotUsername?start=ref_USERID`
- **Referrals only count when users join a group** (not just starting the bot)
- Each user counts once (when they join their first group)
- All referral data is stored persistently in `config.json`
- Users cannot refer themselves
- Referral relationships are tracked permanently
- Statistics update in real-time

## Configuration

The bot stores configuration in `config.json`:

**Storage Location:**
- **On Render**: `/var/data/config.json` (persistent disk)
- **Locally**: `/var/data/config.json` (or current directory if `/var/data` doesn't exist)

```json
{
  "welcome_message": "Your custom welcome message",
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id-here",
      "name": "Group Name",
      "invite_link": "https://t.me/+xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    }
  ],
  "referrals": {
    "users": {
      "123456789": {
        "referral_count": 5,
        "referred_by": null,
        "joined_at": "2025-10-28T12:00:00.000000",
        "has_joined_group": true
      },
      "987654321": {
        "referral_count": 0,
        "referred_by": "123456789",
        "joined_at": "2025-10-28T12:05:00.000000",
        "has_joined_group": true
      },
      "555555555": {
        "referral_count": 0,
        "referred_by": "123456789",
        "joined_at": "2025-10-28T12:10:00.000000",
        "has_joined_group": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This file is automatically created and managed by the bot. **Do not edit manually** unless necessary.

**Field Explanations:**
- `referral_count`: Number of people this user has successfully referred (who joined groups)
- `referred_by`: User ID of who referred this user (null if not referred)
- `joined_at`: When the user first started the bot
- `has_joined_group`: Whether the user has joined at least one group (referrals only count when true)

In the example above:
- User 123456789 has referred 5 people who joined groups
- User 987654321 was referred by user 123456789 and has joined a group (counts as a referral)
- User 555555555 was referred by user 123456789 but hasn't joined a group yet (doesn't count yet)

**Important:** The persistent disk at `/var/data` ensures your configuration survives service restarts on Render.

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond to commands

**Check:**
- Bot is running in Render dashboard
- Environment variables are set correctly
- Check Render logs for errors

### "Access denied" when using /admin

**Solution:**
- Verify your user ID is in `ADMIN_IDS` environment variable
- Get your user ID from `@userinfobot`
- Update environment variable in Render
- Restart the service

### "Couldn't generate invite link" error

**Common causes:**
1. Bot is not in the group
   - Add the bot to your private group

2. Bot is not an administrator
   - Make the bot an admin in group settings

3. Bot doesn't have "Invite Users" permission
   - Edit bot's admin permissions
   - Enable "Invite Users via Link"

4. Wrong Chat ID
   - Verify the Chat ID with `@userinfobot`
   - Chat IDs are negative numbers for groups

### Group added but validation failed

**What it means:**
- The group was added to the system
- But the bot couldn't verify access to it

**Fix:**
1. Ensure bot is in the group
2. Make bot an administrator
3. Give "Invite Users" permission
4. Try generating a link by using `/start` as a regular user

### Config file issues

**If config.json gets corrupted:**

1. Stop the bot
2. Delete `config.json`
3. Restart the bot (it will create a new default config)
4. Re-add your groups through the admin panel

## Security Best Practices

1. **Protect Admin IDs:**
   - Never share your `ADMIN_IDS`
   - Only add trusted users as admins

2. **Monitor Bot Activity:**
   - Check Render logs regularly
   - Look for unauthorized access attempts

3. **Bot Permissions:**
   - Only give necessary permissions in groups
   - Remove bot from groups no longer in use

4. **Single-Use Links:**
   - Links automatically expire after one person joins
   - No risk of link sharing

5. **Regular Audits:**
   - Review group list periodically
   - Remove inactive groups

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Admins

Add multiple admin user IDs separated by commas:

```
ADMIN_IDS=123456789,987654321,456789123
```

### Custom Welcome Message with Markdown

The bot supports Telegram markdown in welcome messages:

```
*Bold text*
_Italic text_
`Code`
[Link text](https://example.com)
```

### Logging

The bot logs all important events:
- Admin actions (add/delete groups, edit messages)
- Link generation requests
- Errors and exceptions

View logs in the Render dashboard under "Logs" tab.
